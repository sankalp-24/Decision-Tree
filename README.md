# Decision-Tree

ABSTRACT : Heart disease is easier to treat when it is detected in the early stages. Machine learning techniques may aid a more efficient analysis in the prediction of the disease. Moreover, this prediction is one of the most central problems in medicine, as it is one of the leading diseases related to an unhealthy lifestyle. So, an early prediction of this disease will be useful for a cure or aversion.

PROBLEM STATEMENT : Analyze the heart disease dataset to explore the machine learning algorithms and build decision tree model to predict the disease.


APPROACH : To develop a machine learning model that predicts the presence of heart disease based on patient health indicators.


Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn


Key Steps:
	•	Conducted data cleaning and preprocessing, including encoding categorical variables and handling missing data.
	•	Explored data with visualizations to understand the distribution of features and their impact on the target variable.
	•	Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier to model the prediction task.
	•	Visualized the tree structure for model explainability and interpretability.
	•	Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

 
Outcome: Achieved a transparent and interpretable model that can assist in the early detection of heart disease, enabling data-driven healthcare decisions.
