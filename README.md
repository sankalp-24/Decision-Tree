# Decision-Tree

ABSTRACT : Heart disease is easier to treat when it is detected in the early stages. Machine learning techniques may aid a more efficient analysis in the prediction of the disease. Moreover, this prediction is one of the most central problems in medicine, as it is one of the leading diseases related to an unhealthy lifestyle. So, an early prediction of this disease will be useful for a cure or aversion.

PROBLEM STATEMENT : Analyze the heart disease dataset to explore the machine learning algorithms and build decision tree model to predict the disease.

APPROACH :
