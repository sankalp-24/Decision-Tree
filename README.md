🫀 Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

💡 Abstract
Heart disease is easier to treat when detected early. Leveraging machine learning, we can make diagnosis faster and more efficient — potentially saving lives. As one of the leading lifestyle-related diseases, early prediction is critical for timely treatment or prevention. This project focuses on building a Decision Tree model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health indicators.

⸻

📌 Problem Statement
Analyze the heart disease dataset to explore machine learning algorithms and develop a Decision Tree Classifier that predicts the presence of heart disease.

⸻

⚙ Approach
Developed a machine learning workflow to predict heart disease using patient data such as age, gender, cholesterol level, and other health metrics.

Tools & Libraries
Python | Pandas | Seaborn | Matplotlib | Scikit-learn

Key Steps
	•	🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and standardized data.
	•	📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – visualized feature distributions and identified key factors affecting heart disease.
	•	🌳 Model Building – implemented a Decision Tree Classifier for its simplicity and interpretability.
	•	👁 Model Explainability – visualized the tree structure to understand decision paths.
	•	📈 Model Evaluation – assessed using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

⸻

🏆 Outcome
Created a transparent and interpretable model capable of assisting healthcare professionals in the early detection of heart disease, enabling data-driven healthcare decisions and improving patient outcomes.
